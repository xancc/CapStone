London’s house prices are considerably higher, and has been consistently rising exponentially much faster than other parts of the UK, where median house prices as of 2014 were as high as £860,000 in Westminster due to the 11.4 percent increase from 2009, based on land registry data. 
This compares to a London borough low median house price of £215,000 in Barking and Dagenham which also went up 6.1 percent since 2009, and is still higher than the national average for England and Wales of £192,000 which also experienced an increase of 2.6 percent since 2009.

The observed increases in the price of the average London home have far exceeded growth in individual earnings, this has led to the economic definition of housing affordability which is the relationship between market-determined housing costs and the ability to pay for them. 
It does not relate to the concept of ‘affordable homes’, which refers to social rented, affordable rented and intermediate housing, provided to specified eligible households whose needs are not met by the market.
Evidence from academic research suggests that the wider benefits of urban living may explain a part of the difference in housing costs across cities and over time, as for example, cities have become safer, less crime-ridden places to live and a vibrant cultural life has given cities an edge in attracting talent. 

There is considerable public debate and concern over the affordability of house prices in London, and where would be the best places to live based on recent economic events that have possibly influenced a vast majority of UK sectors including housing prices, as the desire to purchase a house will be affected by demand.
High house prices in a particular area may therefore reflect a relative abundance of amenities and offer residents a high quality of life, and as London possesses abundant amenities and access to employment opportunities, this may to some extent compensate its residents for the high costs of housing.
